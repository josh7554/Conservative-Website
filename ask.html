      <h3>Who are the main leaders in the Conservative Party and who will be stepping up for Stephen Harper?</h3>
      <p>The main leaders vary depending on which general riding you live in. For example, in Langley, the "main leader" would be Mark Warawa. As to who may be stepping up for Harper, there is no single candidate; but, rather a multitude of them. In the near future, we may be seeing names such as Jason Kenney, Kellie Leitch, Lisa Raitt, Jean Charest or others soon brand the Conservatives as leader.</p>

      <h3>What are the Conservatives planning to do to rebound after the overwhelming federal election loss?</h3>
      <p>As for plans to try to regain popularity and be able to have a chance at re-election during the next federal election, I’m unsure and believe that it is too early for their plans to have been released to the general public; however, they will go back to—what I think is their roots—economics.</p>

      <h3>Why do the Conservatives seem to be under constant pressure by the media?</h3>
      <p>	The Conservatives are being criticized for a number of actions—all of which come from many sources that may or may not be biased in one way or another. For one, however, Harper had intentions to put boots on the ground in Iraq. A lot people were in dismay over this and protested. Secondly—and maybe most importantly—members of the Conservative party have denied their belief in climate change and global warming; along with this, Harper won’t even acknowledge anything about climate change and would rarely speak of the environment as a high priority. Which, in my eyes, I find problematic.</p>

      <h3>What have the Conservatives done to deserve all of this doubt and concern over their philosophies and ideologies?</h3>
      <p>Similar to my answer in question 3, Harper and the Conservative Party seem to just do and say things that people don’t understand. For example, the ban they tried to institute on women wearing a niqab during official Canadian oaths; or how Harper wants to punish crime doers unfairly.</p>

      <h3>How are the Conservatives going to make an impact on Canada and it's people with a minority seating?</h3>
      <p>I expect to see the Conservatives to still fight hard for a chance to influence Canada. Though with minority seating, they will only really be able to get their beliefs across through the small amount of municipalities that they govern. For the time being, the Conservatives will remain in the shadow of this political war. </p>

      <h3>How are the Conservatives different from the Liberals? What set the Liberal Party apart and allowed for them to form a majority government during this year's federal election?</h3>
      <p>The literal meaning of the word “liberal” is to be “open to new behavior or opinions and be willing to discard traditional values.” And that’s exactly what they are. Trudeau has brought in a whole new set of ideas people aren’t used to—but love. The meaning for the word “Conservative” is,” “to hold onto traditional attitudes and values while being cautious about change or innovation” An exact polar opposite from the meaning of Liberal. The meaning of the words themselves insinuate their differences.</p>
