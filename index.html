      <h1>What did I know beforehand?</h1>
      <p>Disclaimer: A lot of this is just what I believe and the reader must realize that these are completely my opinions. There also may be flaws in the architecture and information of these paragraphs; before this project, I knew very minimal about Canadian politics.</p>
      <p>Before starting my project, I had very little knowledge on the Conservative party and their ideas and logistics. However, I did know a few things. For example, from reading different articles and hearing things, I can say—somewhat confidently—that the Conservative Party likes to heed on economics. I know this because—especially while looking at articles online in class—Harper didn’t have much to say about the environment or other political issues but rather relied on the economy.</p>
      <p>I also knew that the media—and so many people—hated Harper! Whether because of a lack a change (sticking to traditional CONSERVATIVE values) or because of his actions and beliefs, I’m unsure; maybe the media just wanted somebody to blame for all the problems happening inside the country. Along with this, I knew that there was some controversy over the Conservative Party not wanting those who wore niqabs to wear them during official Canadian oaths.</p>

        <h1>What did I ask?</h1>
        <p>The asking part of this project was the hardest. It was quite difficult to figure out what to ask—of what I didn’t already know—at first thought; but, eventually I got the hang of it and I know now that I came up with a great set of questions to work with. For example, I questioned Harper’s reliability and also who was going to step up for him.  Along with this, I wondered how the Conservatives were going to rebound after a hard federal election loss and be able to do anything with a Liberal government.</p>
        <p>Along with this, I really just wanted to understand why the Conservatives were getting so much hate on social media and in real life. What did they do to deserve this much hatred upon what they believe in? Maybe they said some inconsiderate or nonsensical things; if they did, I was unaware.</p>
        <p>There was one question that I really wanted to know however; how the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party differentiated themselves from each other. What did the Liberal party do to set themselves apart from the rest of the parties? More specifically; how they were different from the Conservative party this year that allowed them to be able to form a majority government.</p>

        <h1>What did I learn?</h1>
        <p>I learned a lot doing this project. Not only what Harper and the Conservatives did, but also why they did it. Before this project, I kind of thought that the party’s ranks were kind of like a ladder. There was somebody at the top who was the head of everyone else and there were people below the head who had more influence on people farther down the ladder; however, I learned that this was untrue. Yes, there is a big guy at the top—Harper—but there’s also sort of a plateau of rank. I believe that it sort of goes like this; Prime minister -> MP’s -> MLA’s -> to those who work locally in municipalities.</p>
        <p>Sadly, I couldn’t find much about the Conservative’s plan to rebound and get back into the political game. Nonetheless, I’ve heard they aren’t admitting to the blame for the election loss. Apparently they are blaming it on the voters—what? By the time they settle every thing and get back to order, I believe that they will go back to economics as their main focus.</p>
        <p>Possibly the most fun part of researching, I asked why were the Conservatives under constant pressure from the media and why were their ideas and philosophies being questioned. I answer with this; Harper had intentions to put Canadian soldiers in Iraq—in a war we don’t need to fight. I also learned that members of the Conservative party have completely denied their belief in climate change; all the while, Harper continues to neglect any subject regarding the environment.</p>
        <p>The most intriguing part for me doing this project was differentiating the Liberals from the Conservatives and figuring out how they set themselves apart. Upon researching, I immediately found the literal meaning of both the words “liberal” and “conservative”. This was an eye opener for me. Turns out both words are almost exact polar opposites of each other, and the descriptors for these words reflect each party respectfully. To be conservative means, “to hold onto traditional attitudes and values while being cautious about change or innovation”; while to be Liberal means, “to be open to new behavior or opinions and be willing to discard traditional values”. Polar opposites.</p>
