      <h1>What did I know beforehand?</h1>
      <p>Disclaimer: A lot of this is just what I believe and the reader must realize that these are completely my opinions. There also may be flaws in the architecture and information of these paragraphs; before this project, I knew very minimal about Canadian politics.</p>
      <p>Before starting my project, I had very little knowledge on the Conservative party and their ideas and logistics. However, I did know a few things. For example, from reading different articles and hearing things, I can say—somewhat confidently—that the Conservative Party likes to heed on economics. I know this because—especially while looking at articles online in class—Harper didn’t have much to say about the environment or other political issues but rather relied on the economy.</p>
      <p>I also knew that the media—and so many people—hated Harper! Whether because of a lack a change (sticking to traditional CONSERVATIVE values) or because of his actions and beliefs, I’m unsure; maybe the media just wanted somebody to blame for all the problems happening inside the country. Along with this, I knew that there was some controversy over the Conservative Party not wanting those who wore niqabs to wear them during official Canadian oaths.</p>

        <h1>What did I ask?</h1>
        <p>The asking part of this project was the hardest. It was quite difficult to figure out what to ask—of what I didn’t already know—at first thought; but, eventually I got the hang of it and I know now that I came up with a great set of questions to work with. For example, I questioned Harper’s reliability and also who was going to step up for him.  Along with this, I wondered how the Conservatives were going to rebound after a hard federal election loss and be able to do anything with a Liberal government.</p>
        <p>Along with this, I really just wanted to understand why the Conservatives were getting so much hate on social media and in real life. What did they do to deserve this much hatred upon what they believe in? Maybe they said some inconsiderate or nonsensical things; if they did, I was unaware.</p>
        <p>There was one question that I really wanted to know however; how the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party differentiated themselves from each other. What did the Liberal party do to set themselves apart from the rest of the parties? More specifically; how they were different from the Conservative party this year that allowed them to be able to form a majority government.</p>
